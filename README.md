# APNAPLATES
## Automated Valutions:

This program was developed to automate the process of valuating a number plate by asking key questions to determine an overall value.

### Approach / How it works:
The program asks the user a set of questions and then assigns a value depending on the answer. Once you have answered all the questions then the output will show the current value of your number plate.


### The build:
This was initially built to be used internally and therfore it accessed via the terminal and developed in Ruby.

Once I a have reached MVP then I will think about what stack I should use and therfore build a frontend and make it available online asap.

### Problems & Challenges:
Asking the right questions and then thinking about all the permetations as well as allocating a value for every answer to build the valuation takes some time.

Obviously I will be using my knowledge and experience to ask the right questions and create a value however I know that this will need constant tweaking and testing so this project will be ongoing for the forseeable future.
